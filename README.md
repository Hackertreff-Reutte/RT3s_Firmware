# RT3s Custom Firmware

This repo contains a non-functional, but most of the times working firmware for
the RT3s handheld radio.
The project resulted as an attempt to create a user-friendly entry into
firmware hacking and development for the RT3s. I choose platform io, because most
Maker are already familiar with it (Arduino), it also allows the compliation and
upload of the firmware by the press of a button, which is quite nice.

## Goals
